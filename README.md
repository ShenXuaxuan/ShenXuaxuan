This is the personal profile readme about me !!!

### Hi there 👋 I'm Xuan Shen,

**About me**
 
 💼 I am a PhD student at the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Dr. [Xianhui Lu](https://dblp.org/pid/40/7264.html)

 ❤️ My research passion is Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

 📈 I'm new to GitHub and excited to share more FHE-related code in the future

 💬 If you're also interested in FHE, feel free to email me at shenxuan@iie.ac.cn.

 ❤️❤️ By the way, if you're into blockchain, check out my boyfriend's GitHub page,[skyonedot](https://github.com/skyonedot). It's a treasure trove!
